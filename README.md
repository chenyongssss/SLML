# SLML
A learned conservative semi-lagrangian finite volume method by Yongsheng Chen, Wei Guo, Xinghui Zhong

This is an example demonstration of SLML method, which includes the linear square and triangle.
You can run the demo.ipynb file to verify exact mass conservation at the discrete level. Our method is based on the semi-Lagrangian finite volume scheme.
To learn more about the method, you can see the papar "A learned conservative semi-Lagrangian finite volume scheme for transport simulations".
